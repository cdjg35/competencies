# Competency - Burndown

Burndown is a mechanism to visualize an at risk sprint or any arbitrary collection of work.  It should be used in conjunction with [Relative Estimation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8zxn_BM5s6U5kKuidsS7VEIDAh_mBeSOtw_997C0wE/edit#)

The slope of the burndown tells us if a project going to take longer than the projected amount of time, and if so, should we reset the expectation for delivery date, or should we reduce scope to protect the delivery date?

Sometimes the slope indicates a faster delivery time and then we can decide to increase scope or pull in the delivery date.

A danger of a burndown chart is that they can be interpreted by developers as a push to move faster or take shortcuts if the delivery date is perceived as at risk, but this is not the correct action.

## How do you prove it?

You can amalgamate multiple teams / multiple projects into a single summary view.
