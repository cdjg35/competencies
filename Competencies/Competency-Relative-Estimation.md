# Competency - Relative Estimation

Estimation is hard, and specifically humans aren't very good at estimating how long something will take when they try and discretely estimate the time a task will take.  However, they are pretty good at saying that task A is about twice as much work as task B.  In this way, relative estimation is used to generate a ratio of work done to time, which allows us to predict into the future when tasks will be completed.

## How do you prove it?

You know where your team baseline board is.  

You refresh your baseline board once a quarter or so.

After a few iterations on a stable team, your burndowns, by and large, start to get to zero without sprint modification.

You can explain the scale that your team uses, and why they use it. 

In a stable team, you frequently reaches consensus on tickets without a lot of discussion.

When estimates between team members differ you can explain the process used to surface the differences.

You can explain why velocity is dangerous to be shared outside of the team that uses it.

You can explain why velocity cannot be compared across teams.
