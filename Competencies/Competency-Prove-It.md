# Competency - Prove It

The "prove it" section of a competency document describes how you would prove to your manager that you do indeed have this competency.

Writing a good prove it section is what this document is about.

## How do you prove it?

You have written 5 prove it sections of competencies and had them reviewed and accepted.

The prove it sections you write are actionable and lead to auditable results.

The prove it sections you write are clear and unambiguous.

Where applicable, the prove it sections you write can be audited by a non-manager.

## How do you improve it?

Typically, you can only write an prove it section for a skill you have.  It requires you to have an intuitive understanding of what an employee must display in order to convince you and others that they have this competency.

Think about the actions someone would have to perform to prove this.  

Additionally, think about the things that they cannot do to prove it, for example, running a good one on one requires you to gather proof from that persons direct reports, not directly from them.  Some of the proof points need to come from other people, and this proof must also be auditable.
