# Competency - Squad Health Checks

A lot of companies experiment with ways of measuring and visualizing how their teams are doing. A systemic approach with clear visualization can reduce some of the guessiness.

## How do you prove it?

* You have run through the "Squad Health Check" exercise more than once with your teammates

* You're able to discuss who the health check model is for, and some of the benefits of reviewing team cohesion

* You can speak to why this exercise should carry with it no incentives

* You're familiar with (or have improved upon) the structure of the Squad Healtch Check RTB template. 

* Team mates are generally satisfied that the exercise happens on a quarterly basis, and the previous results are reviewed at the start of the next session.

## How do you improve it?

* Read the [post from spotify that introduced the framework](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/)

* As an individual contributor: take part in squad health check exercises

* As a team lead, run squad health checks with your team on a quarterly basis. Archive the relevant artefacts for future review

* Make sure the questions are about the environment in which the squad operates, and not about hard output (like velocity)

* Suggest new situational categories, depending on the team and scope of work, that can be added or swapped in
