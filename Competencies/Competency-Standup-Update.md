# Competency - Standup Update

How do you effectively communicate codebase changes and blockages to the team.  

## How do you prove it?

You deliver standup updates that inform team members and pull in support on blockers.

## How do you improve it?

Surface workflow issues to managers early when you have them.

Focus on concisely describing technical issues.

Try and answer the following questions:

* What specific things did you complete yesterday, and how would you briefly describe your approach to these things? (This would allow the rest of the team to know how it relates to their own work, and give them a chance to later ask you questions or give you advice about your methods.)

* What specific things do you plan to work on today, and how would you briefly describe the approach you intend to take? (This would allow the rest of the team to later share pointers if they have done something similar, or to approach you about swarming on a task when needed.)

* What would allow you to go faster or do your work better? (This would allow the rest of the team to offer assistance in the form of advice or swarming, even when you are not actually stuck.)
