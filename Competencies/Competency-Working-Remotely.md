# Competency - Working Remotely

Working remotely != working from home, we have remote offices.

## How do you prove it?

* When working remotely, nobody is left wondering if you're available or not

* Tasks on your plate are consistently completed regardless of work location

* Your meetings are run remote-first

## How do you improve it?

* When a conversation shifts from real life to slack, you're careful to add additional context to the chat so that remote folk understand. For instance: Imagine a joke is delivered in real life and someone drops the punch-line into chat.

* On slack, you make use of status channels and always ensure your team knows where you're at and whether you're available.

* Slack statuses: You make use of slack statuses to communicate when you're around or away, and you know to post in #swubie-status if you want to let the most folks know about your status

* Make sure that Asana is your source of truth for any important notes (or that documents are linked to asana whenever possible)

* Ask your manager about working remotely more frequently

* Meetings are run effectively (see the "Meetings" competency) with the added requirement that remote-first practices are followed:

    * Presentation is facilitated via zoom for remote callers

    * (Discussion in "living room" always makes use of ball mic.)

    * Zoom chat is monitored

    * Anyone presenting has a headset or clear access to mic/headphones

    * Folks on the call who are less engaged are actively encouraged to participate so the "loudest voice at the table" doesn't dominate the conversation.
