# Competency - Working Remotely

Working for a tech company brings with it the incredible privilege of enabling workers to work remotely! Since we're all working on our laptops every day already, we can use the power of the internet to connect with one another virtually when the need arises. Some folks go remote so they can take on more of a nomadic lifestyle, while others working remote might opt for a coworking space so they can still "come in" every morning.

But working remotely isn't all fun and games. With great power comes great responsibility. Folks that are competent in the "working remotely" competency take additional steps to ensure their collaborating effectively despite any distance.

## How do you prove it?

* When working remotely, nobody is left wondering if you're available or not

* Tasks on your plate are consistently completed regardless of work location

* Your meetings are run remote-first

## How do you improve it?

* When a conversation shifts from real life to slack, you're careful to add additional context to the chat so that remote folk understand. For instance: Imagine a joke is delivered in real life and someone drops the punch-line into chat.

* On slack, you make use of status channels and always ensure your team knows where you're at and whether you're available.

* You make use of slack statuses to communicate when you're away

* Ask your manager about working remotely more frequently

* Meetings are run effectively (see the "Meetings" competency) with the added requirement that remote-first practices are followed:

    * Presentation is facilitated via zoom for remote callers

    * (Discussion in "living room" always makes use of ball mic.)

    * Zoom chat is monitored

    * Anyone presenting has a headset or clear access to mic/headphones

    * Folks on the call who are less engaged are actively encouraged to participate so the "loudest voice at the table" doesn't dominate the conversation.
